A-Frame VR Scene Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides an overview and explanation of the A-Frame VR scene, which is an interactive virtual environment that includes a gazebo, pathway, walls, and various decorative elements.

## Technologies Used
- A-Frame: A web framework for building virtual reality experiences using HTML and JavaScript.
- HTML: The basic structure of the webpage.
- JavaScript: For importing the A-Frame library and enabling interactivity.

## **Scene Overview**
The scene includes:
- A ground plane
- A sky background
- A gazebo structure (with pillars, roof, table, and chairs)
- A pathway leading to the gazebo**
- Curved walls for enclosure
- Potted plants for decoration
- Lighting elements
- A camera with controls for user navigation

## Scene Components

### 1. Environment Setup
- `<a-plane>`: Represents the ground.
- `<a-sky>`: Sets the sky color.
- `<a-light>`: Adds ambient and directional lighting to enhance visibility.

### 2. Gazebo Structure
- Platform: A small cylinder to serve as a base.
- Pillars: Cylinders positioned to form support structures.
- Roof: A cone placed above the pillars.
- Table and Chairs: Box and cylinder components arranged to create seating.

### 3. Pathway
- A long rectangular box extending from the gazebo entrance.
- Alternating white stripes to resemble a pedestrian walkway.

### 4. Walls
- Two large curved cylinders to create an enclosed feeling around the gazebo.

### 5. Decorations
- Potted plants made of stacked cylinders.
- Milo tin, milk tin, and cups** added to the table for realism.

### 6. Lighting and Camera**
- Ambient and directional lighting for a natural look.
- A camera entity** for user navigation, with movement controls enabled.

## Navigation and Interaction
- The camera allows first-person movement with `wasd-controls`.
- A cursor is present for potential interactions.

## Conclusion
This A-Frame scene creates a visually appealing VR environment with a gazebo and surrounding area**, using simple 3D primitives, lighting, and user controls. It can be further expanded with animations and interactivity.
